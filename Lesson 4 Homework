## Duck, duck, goose!

## Store your own name in a variable. Ask the user for his/her/their name. Print goose if the user's name matches yours;
## otherwise, print duck. The point of this exercise is to familiarize ourselves with string comparisons.
## Up until now, we have only compared numeric values. Please think about other intances in which string comparisons
## can be useful.

name = "Sarah"
user_name = raw_input ("What is your name?")

if user_name == name:
    print "goose"
else:

## Cash register

## Ask the user to input the prices of 3 items and type of dollar he/she/they wish to use. Let the user know if the amount
## given is enough.

## Hint: account for excess change, just enough change, and too few change.

## Chore assignment

## Let's say you want to randomly assign one of three types of chores (sweeping the floor, dishes, dusting the piano,
## etc.) to your friends and family members. Have the user input his/her/their name and an integer between 1 and 99.
## Based on this number, you will assign a task to the user by printing out his/her/their name and the task.

name = raw_input("What is your name?")
integer = int(raw_input("Type an integer between 1 and 99 to get your chore assignment: "))

if integer % 3 == 0:
    print name,"'s chore: SWEEP THE DUNGEON!"
elif integer % 3 == 1:
    print name,"'s chore: SCRUB THE SLUDGE PITS!"
elif integer % 3 == 2:
    print name,"'s chore: FEED THE DEMON CAT!"

## Lost pet...

## You are searching for your missing pet, whose name and species I leave up to you. Suppose people have been
## calling you to report lost pets they have found. Get the name and species of the pet in question, and
## compare these answers to your missing pet's name and species. Generate appropriate output.

pet_name = raw_input("You're calling about a found pet? What is the pet's name?")
pet_species = raw_input("What is the pet's species?")

## Letter grade calculation

## Ask the user for 3 exam grades, which you will need to store as floating point numbers. Calculate the
## average of 3 grades and its corresponding letter grade. You may use A, B, C, D, without accounting for
## pluses/minuses. Example: user inputs 88.3, 95.7, and 96. He/she/they will then receive a letter grade of A.
## You may choose to print out the average AND the letter grade for debugging purposes.

## Hint: we did NOT learn about elif statements yet, but we did learn about logic operators, which can be used
## to evaluate two or more boolean expressions at once.

Exam1 = float(raw_input("What was your Exam 1 grade?"))
Exam2 = float(raw_input("What was your Exam 2 grade?"))
Exam3 = float(raw_input("What was your Exam 3 grade?"))

Exam_average = (Exam1 + Exam2 + Exam3)/3

if Exam_average >= 90.0:
    print "Your exam average is", Exam_average, "and your final letter grade is A! Woohoo!"

if 80.0 <= Exam_average < 90.0:
    print "Your exam average is", Exam_average, "and your final letter grade is B."

if 70.0 <= Exam_average < 80.0:
    print "Your exam average is", Exam_average, "and your final letter grade is C."

if 60.0 <= Exam_average < 70.0:
    print "Your exam average is", Exam_average, "and your final letter grade is D."

if Exam_average < 60.0:
    print "Your exam average is", Exam_average, "and your final letter grade is F... :("

## Lab assignment

## Rohini suggested a wonderful idea for the class to begin solving lab problems with our current programming
## expertise. Please choose a self-report questionnaire, screening questionnaire, or questions we ask during
## study visits, and devise a series of if statements pertaining to the outcomes of your chosen questionnaire.
## Bring your results to class next week, and share your code with your classmates.
